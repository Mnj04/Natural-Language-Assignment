# Natural Language Processing Assignment

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various NLP techniques and experiments.

## Tasks Covered

### Task 2: Experimental Evaluation of NLP Pipelines
- Implementation of classical NLP pipeline using spaCy
- Implementation of transformer-based pipeline using BERT
- Comparative analysis of both approaches on a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task
- Dataset used: [Named Entity Recognition Corpus](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naseralqaydeh/named-entity-recognition-ner-corpus)

### Task 3: Responsible NLP Case Study
- Analysis of disaster-related tweets classification
- Implementation of text preprocessing and bias detection
- Dataset used: [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data)

### Task 4: Word Representations for Semantic Reasoning
- Implementation of Word2Vec model on Amazon product reviews
